# IP Rights - Commercial and Derivative Works

Forgotten Runes is building a collaborative, decentralized IP that is owned by the token holders.

If you're not a token holder, you're still free to create derivative works as long as they're non-commercial works.

If you are a token holder, you're able to commercialize the works of the tokens that you hold.

Forgotten Runes is **not** CC0. Creative Commons' strength is in it's openness but it makes it difficult to monetize. Our license agreement allows broad collaboration with creators, but still maintains the ablity for token holders to benefit commercially from their IP contributions.

### For NFT Holders

At a high level, you're able to commercialize derivative works from the character that's in your token. You don't owe any royalties until you hit $5 million in lifetime revenue and then after that you'll owe 20% in royalties.

You're welcome to get creative with the art -- modify it, expand it, write a backstory, produce content in any medium. Just make sure your commercial creations don't get too close to someone else's NFT - only commercialize your own character.

### For non-NFT Holders

Feel free to use our art and world for your personal, non-commercial projects. Fan art, avatars, wallpapers are all great. Just don't sell those creations (until you own the NFT).

### For Everyone

**Play Nice:** Whether you're here for fun or commercializing, keep it respectful and lawful. You may not use any of the art e.g. to promote hate or violence.

**Transfers**: Planning to pass your NFT to someone else? The new owner steps into your shoes and agrees to these same terms.

### Full Legalese

Above is a high-level description of the commercial rights. If you're looking for the specifics on the license, you should read the complete [Forgotten Runes NFT License Agreement](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/tos).
